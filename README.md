The Feedulator
==============

The Feedulator is a feed management application that provides functionality for creating and optimizing feeds for farm animals. Designed for both amateurs and expert users, the Feedulator allows users to combine a wide variety of feed components and calculate the nutrition they provide. Once components have been decided, users can utilize the application's powerful optimization functionality to decrease feed costs without sacrificing nutritional content.
